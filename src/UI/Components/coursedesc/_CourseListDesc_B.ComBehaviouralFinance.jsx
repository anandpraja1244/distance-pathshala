              undergraduate degree of 3 years which is further divided into six
              semesters. Behavioural finance is a part of study that discusses
              the concept based on psychology to explain market outcomes and
              peculiarities. An Online B.Com in Behavioural Finance helps
              students or working professionals to study at any time or anywhere
              via online live & pre-recorded lectures. At its core, behavioural
              finance is about identifying and explaining abnormality and
              mispricing in financial markets. It uses experiments and research
              to demonstrate that human beings and financial markets are not
              always logical, and the decisions they make are often flawed. If
              you are wondering how emotions and biases drive share prices,
              behavioural finance offers answers and explanations.

              For the past ten years, behavioural finance has been embraced in
              the academic and financial communities as a subfield of
              behavioural economics influenced by economic psychology. By
              showing how, when, and why behaviour deviates from rational
              expectations, behavioural finance provides a blueprint to help
              everyone make better, more rational decisions when it comes to
              their finances.
