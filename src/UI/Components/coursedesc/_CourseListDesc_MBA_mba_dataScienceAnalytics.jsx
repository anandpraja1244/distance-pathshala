            <p>
              The data science and analytics industry is surely one of the most
              prosperous one currently. 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is
              generated every day in the world and this number is growing at a
              rapid pace. This has in turn increased the need for managing this
              data and hence the need for data science. There are a lot of IT
              professionals in India but the country still lacks professionals
              specializing in data science and analytics domain. The demand for
              data science professionals is extremely high in India, so a career
              in data science and analytics in any job profile is definitely
              worth considering.
