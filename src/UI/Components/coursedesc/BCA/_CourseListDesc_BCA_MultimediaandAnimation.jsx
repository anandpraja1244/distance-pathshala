              Growth in India's animation industry is anticipated to outpace the
              Information Technology (IT) sector. Those who are looking for a
              creative outlet will like the animation industry. Experience
              "enjoy-as-you-work," get personal fulfilment after each day, and
              receive praise from customers to realise your professional goals.
              By 2015, India's animation industry had developed to the point
              where it was no longer only an outsourcing hub but also a source
              of unique, local intellectual property. As of 2019, India was home
              to more than 600 animation companies responsible for the
              employment of an estimated 45,000 animators. The FICCI KPMG
              reports stated that the sector is expanding at a compound annual
              growth rate (CAGR) of 22%, with post-production rising at 15%,
              animation production growing at 9%, and animation services
              expanding at 1%. It is an up-and-coming field. One of the most
              popular new occupations is in the field of multimedia and
              animation today. Aspirants will have a bright future because of
              the rising need for qualified data analytics professionals in all
              sectors of society. The employment market for data analysts is
              looking bright, and many reputable and attractive companies are
              actively hiring in this field. Obtaining this certification will
              improve your employment prospects in the data analytics industry.
